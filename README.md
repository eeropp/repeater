# repeater
This project is the first test project of me, to test using GitHub :)
But actually, it is an Android project. I wanted to wrote a "repeater" to learn english. It can play the mp3 files by spliting into sentences. 
I only complete a simple filter to figure out where the "pause" is, in the ./jni folder. It use libmad to play the mp3 file.
But it is only a toy...
