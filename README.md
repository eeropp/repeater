# repeater
This project is the first test project of me, to test using GitHub :)
But actually, it is an Android project. I wanted to write a "repeater" to play english mp3 files, to play the sentences seperatly.
I only complete a simple filter to figure out where the "pause" is, in the ./jni folder. It use libmad to play the mp3 file.
But it is only a toy...
